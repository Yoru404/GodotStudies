A place for developing games as a student

I'm currently developing games in the godot engine as a student, the games in here come from random tutorials at Youtube, which i will
leave here once i make the games, some games may come from the Godot Engine Game Development 24 Hour Book or come from the Udemy course
made by GameDev.tv, Discovering Godot: Make Video Games in Python like GDScript.

This way here will be my devlog, if you find any erros in the game or ways to make it better in coding please tell me, i'll be happy with 
any new ideas.
